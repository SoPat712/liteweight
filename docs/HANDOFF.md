# liteweight: handoff to the next lead agent

## Final app rename (2026-11-07)
The app is **liteweight**, all lowercase. The project is `liteweight.xcodeproj`, scheme
`liteweight`, with owner team `CSNM446KVY` and app ID `me.joshpatra.liteweight` in both
configurations. Code uses `Liteweight` / `liteweight` prefixes. The repository URL is
`SoPat712/liteweight`; documentation uses `/Users/joshp/Projects/liteweight` as the canonical
workspace path. The checkout root was not moved by this lane.

The new app ID has a separate data container. Use Share Full Backup in the old app and
Restore Backup in liteweight. New files use `.liteweightbackup`; pre-rename backups and
settings still restore. Feedback: `liteweight@joshpatra.me`. Upstream credit remains in About
and README. Rename checks are text/plist/project-list checks only; the lead must build and
verify runtime behavior before installing.

## Customizable Home (2026-11-02)
Build 71 (installed) added This Week styles chosen one at a time, the Muscle Focus target
band, and hide/reorder for sections. Since then, uncommitted and not yet on a device:
- Each This Week view (Rings, Pace, Muscle Week, Daily Volume) is its own Home card, so any
  number show together. Customize Home lists the cards on Home (delete, drag) and the ones
  to add. The first week card is "This Week" with Start Workout. See DESIGN_SYSTEM §15.2.
- Code: `liteweight/UI/Components/HomeWeekViews.swift`, `FeedView.swift`; tests in
  `liteweightTests/ThisWeekWidgetDataTests.swift` (`HomeWeekSummaryTests`).
- Debug flag `-liteweightInspectCustomizeHome` opens Customize Home on its own.
- The shared phone simulator stopped accepting simhid taps and drags on 2026-11-02, and
  Simulator.app is not installed with this Xcode. Check lower Home cards by writing
  `home.cards` (for example `bars,pace`) with `simctl spawn … defaults write`.
- Not seen working: the ••• menus and taps in Customize Home (no touch input in the simulator).

## Build 57 RPE-first flow (2026-10-31)

- After Log Set, RPE opens first and slides to the rest screen on ✓ or after 5 s untouched. Rest has a back button to RPE; that return, and RPE opened by hand, wait for ✓.
- Fixed RPE spreading across sets: opening the page saved the suggestion copied from the previous set, which then became the next suggestion. Opening never saves now.
- Rest screen: −15/Skip/+15 are larger in-page capsules instead of the native bottom bar, and the ring shrinks to clear them (§22.0). Weight and reps digits roll up or down with the scroll wheel.
- Checked by timed simulator shots at 40 mm and Ultra (`~/.local/share/liteweight/screens/flow/`). Rolling digits and the real wrist timing need a workout; simulator shots can't show them. Unit suite not rerun: only Watch view and navigation code changed, and `liteweightTests` doesn't cover them.
- Build 58: removed the Edit Set row from the Now page at the owner's request; its other rows were already there. The set editor stays reachable from the exercise's set list and as a VoiceOver action, and it's the only place with Mark as Done / Not Done.

- Build 60: the green bar beside the scroll wheel on value controls is gone by using continuous rotation. Disassembling `CrownSequencer.update(with:)` in the Watch's 27.0.1 SwiftUI (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/watchOS DeviceSupport`) shows the bar is only enabled when `isContinuous` is false; `.digitalCrownAccessory(.hidden)` doesn't reach it. `watchCrownRotation` in `WatchDesign.swift` pads the range and holds values at their limits, because continuous rotation wraps. Build 59's root `.scrollIndicators(.hidden)` was the wrong theory and was reverted. The wheel can't be exercised here: this Mac has no Simulator.app and Xcode 27's test connection hangs (throwaway probe in `~/.local/share/liteweight/crown-ui`), so limits and feel need checking on the Watch.

- Build 61: tapping a selected tile again now hands the scroll wheel back to the page on the Now page and plate calculator (`watchReturnsCrown`); before, the wheel did nothing until a finger scroll. Owner confirmed build 60 removed the green bar. The wheel can't be tested here, so the owner needs to confirm this too. The full set editor still keeps the wheel on its value and has no deselect.
- Build 62: Watch lists now end 6 pt (small Watches) or 10 pt (larger) from the screen edge instead of about 49–70 pt; the Exercises page keeps its clearance for the page dots. On 2026-11-01 liteweight stopped launching on the iPhone because its signing certificate was revoked and Xcode showed No Accounts. The owner signed back in at Xcode > Settings > Accounts, Xcode issued a new certificate, and build 62 is installed on both devices.
- Build 63: the owner found build 61's wheel hand-back did nothing. `watchReturnsCrown` now rebuilds the ScrollView when a field stops editing, because watchOS only gives a ScrollView the wheel when it appears or is touched. Moving focus to it, directly or with `resetFocus`, failed. The rebuild returns the page to the top. Wheel behavior can now be tested in the Watch simulator: `~/.local/share/liteweight/crown/simhid <udid> crown <delta> [count]` sends real wheel input (delta 3 × 15 is a good start) and `tap`/`drag` send touches, using ratios of the screen.
- Build 64: build 63 froze the app (100% CPU layout loop) when a NavigationLink was tapped with a box selected, because opening the link ended editing and rebuilt the ScrollView holding the link. `watchReturnsCrown` now only rebuilds while on screen. The Bar Weight page also owns its editing state, since a NavigationLink destination never saw the parent's change. Checked with real wheel and touch input on Ultra and 40 mm: edit, confirm, scroll, re-select, switch boxes, Log Set from a selected box, and links opened with a box selected. Confirming on Bar Weight then scrolling was checked on Ultra only. A device check by the owner is still needed.
- Build 65: the rest ring's next-exercise line is limited to the circle's width at that height, so it no longer touches the ring. Most names lose the "Next ·" prefix and very long names truncate. 40 mm still hides this line because its ring is under 120 pt.
- Build 66: Watch notes are text only, with no audio kept. Note rows say "Add Note" or preview the note, and an empty plan note has no row because it can only be written on iPhone. The note page has no Edit, Dictate, Save or Cancel buttons: tapping the note box opens the system text input with the note filled in, Done saves and Cancel changes nothing. The box is drawn over a TextField because a Watch TextField shows one truncated line in its own box. The Watch list's bottom clearance went from 6/10 pt to 8/14 pt at the owner's request.
- Next build, not yet installed: the Siri extensions are shelved (see Signing below). A cold launch with a workout in progress now starts the Live Activity with no taps, because `sceneDidBecomeActive` starts it instead of SwiftUI's scene phase. Old black-and-white exercise diagrams are gone from thumbnails: `legacy-art.json` gives 116 of the 117 legacy exercises the reviewed picture of the same movement, and Supermans has no match so it shows the neutral figure. OpenGym text moved to revision `b6cfe2b`, which changed the equipment of 46 entries. Default exercise lists now show 1,383 of 5,749 built-ins, and search or "Show N More Exercises" reaches the rest; nothing is deleted. See `docs/EXERCISE_CATALOG_AUDIT.md`.
- Build 69: History row badges no longer compress, which had wrapped "1 PR" one letter per line. The iPhone effort graph now draws ten separate bars, one per level, instead of masking four tier shapes with a moving hard edge.
- Build 68: the logger's collapsed pill adds live heart rate and calories while the Watch is sending them, and "1 set" is now singular. The session bar shows a 1 pt gap between sets and 4 pt between exercises. The Watch rest screen moves the ring beside a vertical column of buttons, which flips for the right wrist, with the full exercise and weight × reps along the bottom. The RPE sheet fits its content on an opaque background with solid bars. Change plates draw shorter on both devices. The plate calculator's Use row is gone: Done saves a changed target and swiping down leaves the set alone. Add Exercise keeps Cancel and Add visible during search and prepares its list once, so a keystroke only filters. Recent Workouts rows put Repeat beside the text, with the other actions on a long press. Logging a set keeps it at the top with the rest timer and next set under it. Tapping a weight or reps box selects the value, and a number the user changed reads brighter than one that was filled in. The Live Activity now starts before copying its artwork, because leaving the foreground during that wait lost the request, and a dismissed activity no longer counts as running. Setting RPE before logging no longer reopens the RPE page on either device, and new sets start unrated. The Watch reserves room for its clock, which watchOS removes when the toolbar is crowded, and lines the vitals up with it. The finish screen's session card is now a per-exercise, per-set table, and effort moved above it. Finish matches the timer's height.
- Build 67: the iPhone exercise page's note row now updates after Save. It kept an `@AppStorage` value it never read, so the save was stored but the row stayed stale until the page reopened; it now observes `ExerciseNotes.cache` like the logger. The iPhone effort graph lights only up to the chosen number, the caption that disagreed with the tier name is gone, and the workout detail's effort text uses the same tier names. The Watch home list adds 6 pt of bottom padding.

## Build 56 Watch restore (2026-10-31)

- Claude took orchestration back after the owner stopped the Codex session on build 54 ("absolutely butchered the watch display"). Root cause: the rejected "native first" retheme.
- Restored the approved Now, set editor, rest picker, controls, warm-up and plate components from pre-retheme snapshots in `~/.local/share/liteweight/pre-wr/`, then re-applied only the owner's requests. `b54-*.swift` there are backups of the state before this repair. See `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §22.0, which replaces the native-first rule.
- New: one full-width blue glass primary button (`WatchPrimaryButtonStyle`), fixed-size value tiles, `WatchContentList` as a flat ScrollView, controls filling down to the page dots, RPE number/graph/description layout, no visible Test mode text.
- Verified by simulator screenshots at 40 mm and Ultra (`~/.local/share/liteweight/approved/` refreshed). Unit suite not rerun: only Watch view code changed since 453/453, and the suite doesn't cover those views. Crown feel, auto-accept timing and the freeze fix need a real workout.
- Rest Timer picker is one screen: scroll wheel and Done only. Presets and −15/+15 removed for the owner's no-scroll rule; bring presets back only if they still fit one screen.
- The owner calls the Digital Crown the "scroll wheel"; use that word with them.
- WhereWolf's orchestrator is now a Claude Code session; coordinate with `SendMessage` (coord README rule 1).

## Build 54 flat scrolling — installed on both devices (2026-10-31)

- Owner explicitly rejects shrinking list items at the top/bottom. Changed the common row container from carousel to plain; root applies plain style to native settings/catalog/editor lists too. Constant width/scale, current colors/radii and title-free Home are required. No other layout/action changes.
- **liteweight 1.6 (54) installed and normally launched on the iPhone and Watch; both installed versions read back as 54.** Fresh Watch install followed the owner manually uninstalling it to clear a conflicting installation. iPhone launch initially needed an unlock; Watch network tunnel and process-scoped installation conflicts were resolved before verification.
- Focused Home/options/settings and end-of-list captures passed on Ultra. Five sampled rows retain x=4…417 (414 px / 207 pt) boundaries; last Home card has 42.5 pt of bottom clearance. Source colors/radii and value-editor layout remain unchanged. No full unit-suite repeat for this list-style correction. Receipts/evidence: `docs/qa/watch-flat-54/`.
- Shared slots released; the one Watch simulator is off, no phone simulator booted. Signed build guard mean 32.8%, peak 99.1%, three samples above 80%, 37 throttle intervals; simulator startup/capture sampled up to 100%. The guard is throttling, not a hard aggregate ceiling.

## Build 53 scrolling width and title-free Home — superseded by 54 (2026-10-31)

- Owner reports Home/custom scrolling pages are too narrow compared with native Settings. Converted their ScrollView/stack containers to native carousel List sizing through `WatchContentList`; preserved build 52 row colors, radii and actions. Native List owns first/last-row clearance instead of narrowing the whole page with dial-style scene padding.
- Scope: Home; saved/history lists and details; saved and active supersets; exercise list/detail/options; set-type and plate-choice lists; finish summary. Now/editor, RPE, effort, running rest and rest-length picker retain their existing layout.
- Idle Home omits the app-name title, putting New Workout first beneath native clock chrome.
- Focused native-list checks passed on Ultra and 40 mm, including reachable Home endpoints (painted-card bottom clearance 42.5 pt / 21 pt). Title removal checked on both. Eight value-page component bodies match build 52 exactly; evidence is in `docs/qa/watch-width-53/`.
- **liteweight 1.6 (53) installed and normally launched on both the physical iPhone and Watch.** Signatures verified, both installed versions read back as 53. Receipts are in `docs/qa/watch-width-53/`. No new unit-suite run for this UI correction; build 51 passed 453 tests. No physical Crown gesture or new Health workout was exercised for QA.
- Compiler/check leases released; both Watches shut down after serial checks, no phone simulator booted. Signed build guard mean 25.4%, peak 75.4%, zero samples above 80%, 34 throttle intervals. Simulator startup/checks had higher sampled peaks (up to 100%); this guard is not a hard aggregate CPU ceiling.

## Build 52 surface restoration — prior build, superseded by 53 (2026-10-31)

- Owner rejected build 51's pill-shaped saved workouts and brighter system-gray fills. Restored approved flat Watch surfaces: saved/history/recorded exercise cards, settings symbol wells, selected/current/completed states, Now/editor tiles and control-grid colors. Restored 13 pt card / 15 pt hero corners from the pre-retheme implementation. The metric RGB palette itself had not changed; native button backgrounds had replaced the semantic fills.
- Keep build 51's behavior/layout fixes: narrower weight split, measured read-only Previous, native toolbar actions, hidden Crown/scroll accessories and five-second automatic RPE. No data/sync/Health changes in this correction.
- **liteweight 1.6 (52) installed and normally launched on both the physical iPhone and Watch.** Both app signatures verified, then both installed versions read back as 52. Receipts and fresh screenshots: `docs/qa/watch-restoration-52/`. Eight affected Ultra states inspected; simulator and signed builds passed. No full test-suite repeat for this visual correction; the build 51 run passed 453 tests. Wrist Crown/interaction testing remains with the owner.
- Shared resources released, Watch simulator shut down; no phone simulator booted for this check. CPU guard did throttle owned work but did not impose a hard aggregate ceiling: signed build mean 28.0%, peak 100.0%, seven samples above 80%, 39 throttle intervals. Detailed simulator samples are in the QA readme.

## Build 51 — prior owner-testing build, superseded by 52 (uncommitted)

- Owner rejected the WR Watch appearance after seeing simulator captures: glossy/gradient-looking data tiles and content rows do not match the phone. Follow the phone's flat semantic fields and compact corners, with restrained native Liquid Glass chrome/actions. The WR captures are evidence of the rejected state, not new approvals.
- Owner requested ten percentage points more width for reps: Weight/Reps is now 50/50 on compact Watches and approximately 54/46 on larger Watches, independent of live values.
- Previous must be fully visible on the first screen. It is read-only text, not an entry to a duplicate weight/reps editor. A measured footer now reserves space before hero sizing. The older below-fold rule is superseded.
- Hide the green Crown accessory on main weight/reps as well as RPE and other editors; the main/editor ScrollViews also hide their accessory/scroll indicators. Running rest remains ±15/Skip only. Automatic RPE is five seconds; manual RPE requires confirmation.
- Fresh standalone liteweightTests completed at 00:40 on October 31: **453/453, zero failures/skips**, including all 18 Watch-store concurrency tests. The final view-navigation adjustment was then compiled and checked separately on the Ultra simulator; no full suite was repeated after the CPU-headroom request.
- **Installed and launched on both physical devices: liteweight 1.6 (51).** Both versions were queried directly after installation. Phone install sequence 2584; Watch sequence 888. Both bundle signatures verified before installation. Receipts, version queries and launch results are in `docs/qa/watch-native-2026-10-30/`. The current Watch CoreDevice identifier is `B252916C-22C3-5EF9-9137-6432DB27276B` (hardware UDID `00008320-001F472A2160000A`).
- Now/full editor use the native top trailing checkmark on all sizes. Measured Ultra editor height was 129 pt; a 55.5 pt content action plus Previous left only 25.3 pt for tiles. Moving confirmation to the toolbar restores large values without clipping Previous. This supersedes the larger-Watch content-button rule.
- Simulator-only plates/tracking routes were hanging in SwiftUI layout. Replacing the derived Boolean debug destination with item navigation after a task yield makes both screens render; physical navigation/actions are unchanged.
- Automatic RPE now uses native item navigation rather than a modal, removing watchOS's automatic close X. Targeted captures show only ✓, automatic return to rest, and manual RPE still open after nine seconds. The main value fields hide both their Crown accessory and surrounding scroll indicators. Previous is plain text and does not navigate.
- A broad pass captured 54 fresh default/large-text/timing frames on 40 mm and Ultra before the final presentation-only correction; that correction received a focused Ultra check. Simulator fixtures are demo data and never sensor evidence. No workout was started, finished or discarded on a physical device for QA.
- **Resource rules changed during this run:** keep one shared phone booted, currently WhereWolf Regression `42FA2C2F-F66C-41DB-A33C-A018165BB0D7`; use one Watch only when essential and shut that Watch down afterward. Serialize with `coord.py` and communicate directly with WhereWolf. Old liteweight scripts hard-code the former phone and shutdown behavior: adapt them to the new shared-phone rule before reuse.
- Idle-runtime exception: WhereWolf found both iOS 27 phone runtimes consumed high CPU with the app closed, and shut down the replacement as well. Do not keep an unhealthy idle runtime running merely to preserve a boot. Coordinate shutdown and wait for a safe baseline; never boot a second phone as a workaround.
- CPU guard is `/Users/joshp/Projects/WhereWolf/ci_scripts/resource_guard.py`, used inside the coordinator with specific DerivedData roots. Use jobs1 and the agreed conservative 50% pause / 35% resume thresholds; simulator app monitoring also needs its exact installed executable via `--process-path`. It is sampled throttling, not a hard global ceiling. The signed build reported peak 88.6% and 76 throttle intervals; do not claim it stayed below 80%.
- Next is the owner's direct wrist check: weight/reps Crown indicator, tapping Previous, and the log → RPE → rest flow. Fresh sensors, a completed Health save and end-to-end device sync were not exercised in this session. All liteweight build/check jobs have finished and resource claims are released; WhereWolf continues separately.

## Round 8 and Watch Round 6 built (2026-10-27, uncommitted)

- Watch Round 6 rebuild (spec: `docs/WATCH_DESIGN.md`). The vitals row is pinned under the toolbar on a solid background; the rest ring keeps ±15 beside it; the Crown adjusts rest. Verified on the 42 mm simulator. Ultra size and always-on are not checked yet. Average BPM still needs `WorkoutSessionManager.averageHeartRate`.
- Effort and RPE: Apple-style slanted graphs on iPhone and Watch (`Shared/UI/SwiftUI/SlantedBarShape.swift`, `EffortRatingGraph`, `RPEGraph`, `WatchEffortViews.swift`). A tap on an RPE bar selects it, unfilled bars use `systemFill`, and the disabled Set RPE button is neutral.
- Round 8, owner-approved (`docs/design/phone-past-workout-r8.dc.html`, `phone-settings-r8.dc.html`):
  - The past workout (`WorkoutDetailView`) keeps the same information in logger-style cards, with read-only dates and a zoom transition from History.
  - Settings keeps the same rows, adds colored icon tiles and a header card.
- Imported Data tools (remove imported workouts, replace with a new export) are in `BackupAndExportView`.

### 2026-10-30 overnight: simulators only (uncommitted, not on devices yet)

- **Sync and finish lifecycle fixes** (review lane RV, fixed by SY2, each with a regression test in `WatchCompanionSyncTests`):
  - The worst bug: finishing early on the Watch with unlogged sets was rejected by the phone's Core Data validation (`Workout.validate` code 5). The finish was never acknowledged, so every later sync event stayed blocked in the Watch's ordered outbox. The fix prunes unfinished rows, as the legacy path did.
  - Also fixed:
    - a duplicate finish discarding the Health recording;
    - a relaunch during finalization stranding the Watch;
    - a stale phone context restarting a finished workout (bounded terminal tombstones);
    - Health-failure handling overwriting phone edits;
    - a queued Watch finish resurrecting a phone-discarded workout;
    - phone completion dropping queued Watch value edits;
    - a Watch finish overwriting a newer phone title.
- **Second review round** (RV2, fixed by SY3 and SY3B, with tests):
  - Recovery no longer reopens a discarded workout, and it no longer finalizes a live one because of an editable end date.
  - Post-finish phone corrections now win over older delayed Watch patches, field by field, using bounded finalization baselines. Untouched fields still accept them.
  - The warm-up insert dismisses only after a durable save.
- **RPE sheet idle timer** (FL4): every Crown event, including at the 5/10 limits, and every tap now resets the 4 s auto-accept.
- **Preference merge clocks** for plates, notes and tracking types now persist across restarts (lane PC). The hidden-exercise cache refreshes at catalog request boundaries, which catches writes from other processes.
- **Watch one-screen pickers** (lane FIT):
  - The set editor and the Rest Timer picker now follow §22: a one-line header, a hero value sized from the leftover height, and Log Set or Done pinned at the bottom. Their −/+ rows, presets and settings sit below the fold.
  - The header truncates the exercise name, never "Set 1/3".
- **Warm-up sets on the Watch** (lane WU):
  - The Exercise Options → Warm-up Sets row opens a one-screen list with a pinned "Add N Sets" button.
  - The math lives in `Shared/Data/WarmupPlan.swift`, shared with the iPhone calculator. With a plate setup it rounds to weights that setup can actually load; without one, results are unchanged.
- **This Week widget** (lane WK): small, medium, Lock Screen rectangular and circular families. It uses Home's computed history, so the widget and Home agree. Its visuals are not verified yet, because the simulator can't place widgets from a script.
- **Tests:** 453/453 pass. The 10 Watch-store concurrency tests are now enabled: `WatchWorkoutStoreConcurrencyTests` compiles the real store into liteweightTests.
- **Simulator limits:**
  - On iOS 27, paired-simulator WatchConnectivity is broken: phone `wcd` fails `fetchInstalledApplicationsForPairedDevice` with `NSXPCConnectionInvalid`, so the Watch sees `companionAppInstalled: NO`, even after re-pairing. Verify sync with unit tests and on devices.
  - Use `-liteweightSkipHealthAuthorization` (DEBUG) for iPhone screenshot runs.
  - `~/.local/share/liteweight/phone-screens.sh` takes `LITEWEIGHT_PHONE_ROUTES` (`logger` or any `-liteweightInspect…` suffix). Approved Watch shots are in `~/.local/share/liteweight/approved/`.

### 2026-10-29 afternoon: Codex lanes P–PR2 (uncommitted, on both devices)

- **Plate calculator** (iPhone + Watch), in `Shared/Data/PlateLoadout.swift`:
  - Setup modes are Bar, No Bar and Machine, with a starting weight, plus Both or One side.
  - Users choose their available plates, and each exercise keeps its own setup. Both sync both ways.
  - On the Watch, the target is the editable hero tile, using Now-page steps.
  - The machine diagram is a front view.
- **Set tracking types:** eight types in `Shared/Data/SetTrackingType.swift`.
  - They drive logger columns, Previous, volume, records/PR badges, history, backups (v5) and saved-workout export (v2).
  - Each exercise can override its type; overrides sync with the Watch.
  - The file is internal and compiled into six targets. In tests that import both modules, use a module-qualified name (`liteweight.` or `WorkoutDataKit.`).
- **Sync:** a Watch-started workout is no longer deferred behind an empty phone placeholder. The phone shows "Workout running on Apple Watch", with an "Open on iPhone" action. Ack retries have been added.
- **Live Activity:**
  - The rest bar is a self-updating `ProgressView(timerInterval:)`, with "of M:SS" for the total.
  - Paused rest keeps its interval, and Watch adjustments keep the original start.
  - Incomplete-set squares are visible.
- **Haptics and sounds:** there's an iPhone audit; `RestTimerStore.adjust(by:feedback:)` ticks only for user actions. The Watch uses WatchKit paired cues, which follow Silent Mode, and has a Haptics toggle. The Watch owns rest alerts when it drives the workout.
- **Watch layout:** the rest controls are in the bottom toolbar. The Now page scrolls under the page dots. The weight/reps split is fixed per field, never per live value.
- **iPhone:** the set rows are polished (6 pt gaps, 40 pt badge), and the heart-rate chart scrubs with press-and-hold.
- **Tests:** 368/368 pass. Xcode 27's `xcodebuild test` hangs at the runner handshake, so use `~/Library/Caches/liteweight/standalone/build-and-test.sh` through `coord.py run check liteweight ...`. It's adapted from WhereWolf's in-app runner.

### Build 50 and Watch follow-ups (2026-10-29, uncommitted)

- Build 50 is on the iPhone and Watch. It adds the scrolling Watch Now page (tiles change color only; Set Options below the fold), Health test mode with no HKWorkoutSession, and the R1/R2 review fixes.
- Watch-only fixes after 50, on the Watch with no new version number:
  - Weight tile takes 1.75/2.75 of the row and scales to 0.55, so "173.5" fits next to "12".
  - The controls page grid is Pause | Exercise over Discard | Finish. Large heart-rate and kcal values head the page, followed by sets and volume.
  - The plate calculator draws a mirrored barbell with gym-colored plates (`LiteweightTheme.plate*`), an each-side list with swatches, and a note for any weight that can't be loaded.
- Not yet run on build 50: the unit tests, test mode on a device, and the Crown handoff on a device.

### Build 49 (2026-10-28, uncommitted)
- Add Exercise sheet: the bottom-bar filters are icon-only again (`figure.arms.open`, `dumbbell`, `plus`), tinted accent when a filter is active, matching the Exercises tab.
- Superset sheet: one-line rows (letter badge + name, then "N sets · Equipment"), a legend plus a wrapping A1 · B1 · A2 chip sequence showing every round, and Save in the toolbar instead of a full-width button.
- Workout pill: live Watch heart rate and active kcal on the title row (`ActiveWorkoutPillVitals` observes `liveMetrics` on its own); the inline accessory shows heart rate only.
- Workout detail: a new "Heart Rate" card (`liteweight/UI/History/WorkoutVitalsSection.swift`) reads heart rate samples and summed active energy from Apple Health for the workout's time window: Average, Maximum, Active kcal, plus a line chart with an average rule. It asks for read access the first time and hides itself when Health has no data. In DEBUG, `-liteweightDemoVitals` draws synthetic data.

### Round 10, build 48 (2026-10-28, uncommitted)

Five Codex lanes (W10, W11, P10, S10, H10) carried the Round 9 style to the remaining screens.

- **Watch:**
  - Home, saved workouts, history and settings got larger type and full-width rows, with the primary action at the top.
  - The full set editor reuses the Now tiles and puts Save right under them.
  - Exercise options, set type, superset, the RPE page and the rest picker got bigger full-width rows.
  - On 40 mm the Now header is one line: the name, then "1/3".
- **iPhone:**
  - Unrated RPE opens blank.
  - Set badges show a menu cue.
  - Superset and reorder sheets have full-width rows.
  - The Finish sheet has a pinned Save.
  - The expanded set editor has larger values.
  - Settings subpages use the root's icon-tile cards, and rest lengths are set on the inline ruler.
  - Past-workout exercise editing uses the logger's rows.
  - RestLengthRuler spreads its labels over any range and drops leading zeros ("2:30").

### Round 9 "fill the screen", build 47 (2026-10-28, uncommitted)

The owner approved this round on the canvas page "Round 9 · Fill the screen, smoother flows". Their decision: **keep the iPhone Previous column**.

- **Watch:**
  - The active workout is now three pages: Controls | Now | Exercises.
  - Now shows large weight and reps tiles. Tap a tile, then use the Crown (0.5 lb steps) or ± (5 lb or 2.5 kg) to edit in place, and log from the same page.
  - Rest uses a full-width ring with a −15 · Skip · +15 row.
  - The exercise page moves rest and superset into ⋯.
  - A new workout goes straight to the "First exercise" picker.
  - Now, Rest and Controls ignore the bottom safe area, which is free screen on a page view.
  - The page `accessibilityLabel`s were removed, because they masked every child's label.
  - Plural fixes.
- **iPhone:**
  - Logger: wider cards; the name on one line with "Equipment · Rest 3:00" under it; a slimmer Previous column; wider weight and reps boxes; a superset rail with A/B badges; the idle "Watch not paired" line is hidden.
  - RPE sheet: tap a bar to save.
  - The empty workout lists five recent exercises you can add in one tap.
  - The library and Add Exercise rows give names the full width, with a "Muscle · Equipment · date" line under the name.
  - The exercise detail chart has round y-axis ticks and a fitted range, and its actions sit in a ⋯ menu.
- **Not verified:** the Crown on a device, and the Watch Home → New Workout → picker push.

### QA polish pass, build 46 (2026-10-27, uncommitted)

Walked every screen on the Ultra 49 mm and a temporary 40 mm Watch simulator, and on a temporary iPhone 17 Pro simulator (light and dark). Build 46 is installed on the owner's Watch.

- **Watch:**
  - A black fade under the toolbar keeps the vitals legible when you scroll (`watchHardTopEdge`); system scroll edge effects did nothing on watchOS.
  - Finish summary tiles: `Grid` rows at equal height, one-line labels with short forms ("Avg HR", "Calories"), and values that never truncate.
  - Plurals go through `WatchNumber.count`.
  - Text joined with " · " wraps after the dot (`WatchNumber.joinedForWrapping`).
  - "Move Up/Down" fall back to "Up/Down".
  - The superset row name uses the full width.
  - The RPE and effort pages use `scenePadding` with standard button labels.
  - The rest ring text fits on 40 mm; ±15 is 32 pt below 180 pt widths.
  - The header has a two-line fallback; "UP NEXT · SUPERSET" falls back to a link glyph.
  - The Health failure copy is plain language.
- **iPhone:**
  - Inflected plurals ("1 Workout", "1 set", "1 rep").
  - `String.equipmentTitle` ("EZ Curl Bar", not "Ez-Curl-Bar") everywhere equipment shows.
  - The 1RM change caption reads "past 3 months".
  - The Insights duration axis uses whole hours, and compact values drop ".0".
  - The rest ruler no longer labels 0:30 (it collided with 1:00).
  - The Health settings tile has a visible edge.

## Owner checkpoint: Watch app needs revision (2026-10-26)

The owner rejected the current Watch result and explicitly stopped development. They then
authorized committing and pushing the existing work to preserve it, primarily the iPhone app.
The Watch code is included as a **work-in-progress checkpoint**, not an accepted final design.
This decision supersedes the earlier Watch design approvals and completion language below.

The Watch app still needs a further design/usability pass across Home, the exercise list,
exercise details, set editing and deep menus. Automatic recording/recovery, fresh BPM/kcal,
Always On, Smart Stack opening the local Watch app and a complete on-wrist Health save also
need end-to-end verification. Build 43 reports a running session with matching identifiers,
but fresh sensor values were not verified after its recovery change. Prior test/build results
do not establish owner acceptance or complete physical-device validation.

Preserve the iPhone app's current design and all saved work. Do not resume Watch implementation
or install another build until the owner asks. No workout data was removed for this checkpoint.

## Active follow-up: liteweight rename and Live Activities (2026-10-26)

### Latest steering: exercise-first Watch navigation (2026-10-26)

Owner approved and installed the exercise-first redesign across the entire Watch app.
The authoritative flow is **Home → active exercise list → exercise sets → set editor**.
No global ellipsis; secondary set actions sit behind Settings at the bottom of the set.
Home orders New Workout → Saved Workouts → History. Larger rows show exercise/set totals,
primary muscles and history date/duration. Red BPM/orange active kcal are pinned above the
scrolling body on active pages and deep editors, explicitly unredacted for Always On.
The approved interactive proposal is `light-watch-exercise-first.html` in this thread's
visualization directory (88 browser checks); native layout evidence is in QA_2026-10-26.md.

Signed build **43** is installed: phone sequence **5756**, Watch **1224**. Normal launches
succeeded on both. Full iOS test-bundle compilation and Watch simulator compilation pass.
Regression harnesses pass: 14 actual Core Data synchronization, 13 automatic-start/recovery,
13 actual-manager/mock-HealthKit lifecycle, nine editing/persistence/cache and three exact
superset-membership scenarios.
Modern Watch events carry changed-field masks and explicit addition/deletion IDs, preserving
concurrent phone edits and preventing deleted objects from being resurrected by stale copies.

**Real sensor evidence:** build 41 showed 93 BPM in native diagnostics and then 85 BPM /
**4 active kcal** on the actual display. Reinstall exposed a recovered builder with missing
external-ID metadata. Build 43 reuses the durable projection ID locally while preserving any
actual HealthKit metadata; it does not restart collection or rewrite the live builder.
Thirteen actual-manager/mock-HealthKit scenarios pass, including recovery identity and inactive
session guards. The real build-43 diagnostic confirms the original session is running, IDs match
and the recording error is gone. Initial recovered metrics were still missing; the later
capture failed when the Bluetooth developer tunnel dropped. The final tunnel retry succeeded
and still confirms the same running session without a recording error, but no fresh metrics
were returned. A fresh on-wrist check is pending the owner; do not claim final-build sensor
values were captured yet. Calories
remain Apple's Traditional Strength Training estimate. Earlier D0… Watch projection and A276…
phone mismatch is historical; the latest Watch durable snapshot has converged to A276… with
empty outbox. No workout was finished/discarded or Health data fabricated for QA. Do not claim
that a real Smart Stack tap or a full completed on-wrist Health save was exercised.

The real library contains 5,798 exercise picks and 453 history sessions; zero saved routines
matches the phone's empty routine library. Current identifiers remain compatible; IPv6 stays
Off. Debug device builds write a read-only recording diagnostic to
`Library/Caches/LiteweightRecordingState.json`; it never changes session state or exists in Release.

### Historical Focus implementation and live metrics (superseded navigation)

Owner approved **Focus** and implementation across the **entire Watch app**, including deep
menus and Watch-only training. The approved design is `light-watch-redesign.html`. That earlier
implementation used a single native navigation stack, focused logging, Crown editors,
rest controls, exercise/set management, visual superset selection, reorder, notes, effort and
finish, saved-workout creation/editing/deletion, and cached history/repeat. Phone UI stays on
its existing design. Build **39** is being delivered; final install evidence is below.

Watch independence: bundled 5,749-exercise text catalog; cached full phone library, routines
and history via immutable files. Current snapshot/edit packets stay separate. Oversize
snapshots/events use files; the outbox drains in sequence and removes edits only after the
phone acknowledges durable save. A different phone current workout is preserved; conflicting
unfinished Watch records stay in a separate deferred file until completion. Explicit deletion
IDs remove Watch-deleted sets/exercises without erasing unseen phone additions. Imported
records remain read-only to the Watch event adapter and never export to Health. Repeats use
fresh workout/graph IDs. No Core Data schema or dependency changes.

Native 40 mm/Ultra-size QA caught and fixed field truncation, hidden primaryAction toolbars,
wrapped linked metadata, crowded editor titles and main-action placement. Larger text stacks
the fields. Fixtures are DEBUG + simulator only. Nine persistence/editing, eight actual Core
Data sync, and ten mocked-HealthKit lifecycle cases pass. Actual Ultra launch/capture shows
the dark rest view. The last end-to-end sensor and system Smart Stack tap checks require the
owner wearing/unlocking the Watch and handling Health prompts; never claim these are verified
from unit tests. Owner confirmed the Watch is worn/unlocked and both apps are open; real library delivery is
verified (5,798 exercises and 453 history sessions; no saved routines on this phone). Sensor
recording and Smart Stack tap checks are in progress. Owner corrected the normal path: an active
workout must automatically start/recover Health recording. This is implemented; Record/Retry is
only for failures/denied access. Recovery and start guards prevent duplicate sessions. Owner also requested 0.5 weight steps
for both units: implemented for Crown display/commit and ±, preserving accumulated raw travel.

Build **38** small correctness update is installed (phone **5700**, Watch **1168**); normal
launches succeeded. It adds live Watch HR/estimated active calories to the phone status row,
transient UUID/time-scoped sensor transport, WKSupportsLiveActivityLaunchAttributeTypes, and
correct HealthKit stop/collect/save/end ordering. Start-time edits remain in liteweight while the
Health workout retains its original sensor window/sample associations. Seven telemetry tests
and ten actual-source/mock-HK lifecycle scenarios passed; iOS test-bundle and signed builds
passed. Physical metric values and native local tap still need in-use verification. Forced
restart was auto-review rejected for an active-workout risk; normal launch was used instead.
Owner is actively using devices; do not assume a later screenshot is still liteweight after launch.
IPv6 remains Off; never change it. No workout data was changed for QA.


- Owner approved **Set tile** after reviewing `light-live-activities.html`. Implemented cached
  exercise artwork plus per-exercise blue set cells in compact iPhone/Mac and minimal views;
  no compact stopwatch. Watch shows artwork/name, set position, tile and secondary rest/Skip.
  All ActivityConfiguration families inherit a dark foreground and black activity background.
  Expanded iPhone uses one full-width bottom region below the sensor, with safe content margins.
  Existing rest, pause/resume, Log Set and Undo intents remain available.
- Payload adds an optional completed-set count, preserving legacy decoding. Counts come from
  actual nondeleted sets, never the next set ordinal; legacy snapshots retain position text.
  Three native XCTest cases executed against the extracted production snapshot type passed.
  Simulator app/test-bundle, signed iPhone/embedded Watch, and generic Watch builds passed.
  Full iOS XCTest runtime remains limited by the earlier DTServiceHub stall.
- Owner chose **liteweight**; display names, permission copy, Siri phrases and visible branding are
  updated. README describes current features and credits the upstream project/Karim Abou Zeid; About links to
  this fork and original project. Icon remains the owner's next task. The later final rename (2026-11-07) supersedes the
  earlier decision to keep installed-data identifiers; data now moves by backup and restore.
- Latest installed/launch-verified iPhone update: build **37**, install sequence **5692**.
  This includes the compact tile correction: a 20 pt tile in a 24 pt slot with 6 pt trailing
  clearance, replacing the 24 pt tile that clipped at the curve. Simulator and signed device
  builds passed. Native island visual clearance remains unverified: AXe input returned success
  without changing simulator state. Earlier files named compact/expanded-three-sets are logger
  captures, not evidence of island correctness. Do not claim native clipping QA passed.
- **Watch integrity/install issue resolved.** Owner completed pairing and enabled Developer
  Mode. The actual Ultra 4 is **00008320-001F472A2160000A**, **Watch8,1**, watchOS **27.0.1
  (24R365)**. Do not target the stale original Ultra record 00008301-408D14941E08202E.
  Destination-specific Watch build with `-allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration` succeeded.
  Renewed profile **392ffe10-71b2-4fe1-9641-a13458364910** includes the actual Watch and
  expires **2026-11-02 21:38 UTC**. Signature verification passed; direct Watch install
  sequence **1160** and launch succeeded. CLI screenshot shows **liteweight / iPhone connected**.
  The iPhone was reinstalled with the same renewed embedded Watch profile and launched.
  Actual Watch Smart Stack/full-screen Live Activity still needs a running workout to verify.
- Mac Wi-Fi IPv6 is **Off**, verified after successful pairing. The agent never changed it;
  owner explicitly prefers it remain off. The connection now works with the owner's Wi-Fi
  reconnection/pairing and the iPhone on USB. No unpairing, resets, app deletion, credentials
  or trust/passcode entry by the agent. Binary has arm64 and arm64_32; target resolves watchOS.
- Owner prefers CLI. `idb` is absent; CoreDevice handles device build/install/launch/capture,
  AXe handles simulator input when responsive. `pymobiledevice3 companion list` found the
  correct Watch ID through USB before Xcode discovered it. `devicectl device pairings list`
  is a simulator capability and fails on the physical phone. Device Hub was used for initial
  pairing only. CACE is shut down; compiler and simulator slots returned to WhereWolf.


Written 2026-10-25 by the previous lead (Claude) for Codex or any agent taking over. It holds
the mission, the current state, what the owner wants and how they work, what's left (in priority
order), every UI idea discussed so far, and two ready-to-paste prompts.

Read with: [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), [`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) (how everything
looks) and [`DESIGN_BACKLOG.md`](DESIGN_BACKLOG.md) (B1–B10 specs, lanes, build commands).

---

## Prompt 1: implement the remaining work (paste into `codex exec`)

```
You are working on liteweight, a SwiftUI strength-training app (iPhone + Apple Watch) in this repo.
Read AGENTS.md, docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (all of it), docs/DESIGN_BACKLOG.md §0, and
docs/HANDOFF.md ("Task list") first. They are the spec.

Implement the tasks in docs/HANDOFF.md "Task list" marked [CODEX], in order, starting with T1.
For each task: read the files named, make the change following DESIGN_SYSTEM.md exactly
(LiteweightTheme roles, Font.liteweightMetric, LiteweightMotion + Reduce Motion, 44 pt targets, VoiceOver labels),
and keep all existing persistence, Watch sync, Live Activity and Apple Health behavior.
Never export imported workouts to Health.

Do not commit, push, stash, reset or checkout. Don't touch reference-material/.
Build after each task with the simulator command in DESIGN_BACKLOG.md §0.3 (if the sandbox
blocks xcodebuild, say so once and continue with careful compile-correct code).
Finish with at most 25 lines: per task, the files changed, what you did, and what you could not verify.
```

## Prompt 2: carry on as the lead/orchestrator (paste into a fresh agent session)

```
You are the new lead for liteweight (SwiftUI, iPhone + Watch), taking over from a previous lead.
Read docs/HANDOFF.md fully, then AGENTS.md, docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md and docs/DESIGN_BACKLOG.md.

Your job: (1) keep shipping the owner's goals: finish the app and keep its own Apple-native
design ("if Apple made a strength tracker", not Hevy); (2) work the Task list in HANDOFF.md;
(3) the owner approves visual design before it's built, so propose designs first (describe them
precisely, or mock them in SwiftUI previews and screenshots), and get a yes; (4) split
implementation into parallel lanes with exclusive file ownership (DESIGN_BACKLOG §0.1), run
workers within AGENTS.md's concurrency limits, review every diff yourself, build, and install
on the owner's iPhone (§0.3 commands). Leave changes uncommitted unless explicitly asked;
(5) keep HANDOFF.md, DESIGN_SYSTEM.md and DESIGN_BACKLOG.md current: log
every owner decision and every new idea.

Owner rules: ask before booting a simulator (other apps use the CPU). Push only to the fork's
`origin` (SoPat712/liteweight) main, never upstream, and only when asked. Never enter credentials;
the owner handles Apple ID and trust prompts. Never export imported workouts to Apple Health.
Be fast: the owner tests on their phone daily and wants builds on it quickly.
```

---

## 1. Mission

1. **Finish building liteweight** into a daily-use strength tracker that replaces Hevy for the
   owner. They have already imported their Hevy history.
2. **Give it its own design identity**, Apple-native: "imagine if Apple made a workout
   tracker". It must stop looking like a Hevy copy. The full system is in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

## 2. Current state (2026-11-04, uncommitted working tree)

- **Identity/signing:** the active Debug app is `me.joshpatra.liteweight`; `me.joshpatra.liteweight`
  is retired. Sign through the Xcode account with `-allowProvisioningUpdates`; the API key
  only refreshes existing App IDs and cannot create the new identity.
- **Backup/import:** backup v7 includes portable app settings (`AppSettingsArchive`), alongside
  workout data. Restore → Choose Backup File accepts a backup from Files/AirDrop. Download
  Hevy Import regenerates a CSV of Hevy-imported workouts; the original CSV is not retained.
- **Exercise search:** shared `ExerciseSearch` ranks exact/title matches, aliases, prefixes and
  typo matches, with recency within a match tier; library and add-exercise search use it.
- **Apple Health:** session effort exports as an Apple effort score linked to the existing
  workout, including later edits. Imported workouts never export. Debug Health test mode
  defaults **off**; it must be enabled deliberately to suppress recording/export.
- **Fast checks:** `~/.local/share/liteweight/standalone/build-and-test.sh` compiles with
  `build-for-testing -jobs 8`, then runs the standalone tests; screenshots use layout settling
  rather than long fixed waits. Shared runs still follow the coordinator/resource guard and
  current jobs1 limit; the fast script's job count is not a resource-policy override.

### Historical baseline (commit `c3f401a` on `main`)

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Design system | Documented (`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`), including §16, a recipe for restyling a screen from a screenshot |
| liteweight blue refresh: metric colors, SF Pro bold numerals, motion, original sounds | Shipped |
| Apple Health | Exports **only liteweight-completed** workouts (phone or Watch); imports are never exported; durable retry |
| Hevy CSV import | Fast, off the main thread, progress overlay, tagged `importSource = "hevy"` |
| Logger: focused current-set editor (Logger B), blue completed fill | Shipped |
| B1 swipe-overlap fix, B2 session bar, B3 rest chip + ruler (dial removed), B4 soft set-type fills, B5 RPE bars | Shipped in `d6cdeb5`, **visually unverified** |
| B6 exercise detail (inline progress, history, target map, tooltip) | Shipped in `1ad5e22`, **visually unverified**; hold-and-drag tooltip not done (T3) |
| Recency-first exercise ordering (all lists, search, pickers, Watch) | Shipped in `8387ef4` |
| B8 Workout tab (Recent Workouts + Repeat), B9 Home redesign | Shipped in `c3f401a`, **visually unverified**; empty-state button bug (T1) |
| On the owner's iPhone | Build of `c3f401a` installed 2026-10-22 |
| Pushed to fork | **No.** Commits `3ab7e2f..c3f401a` are local only (push when the owner asks) |
| Unit tests | Exist (`liteweightTests/`), but `xcodebuild test` hung in this environment, so none ran recently |

### 2026-10-25 continuation (uncommitted working tree)

- T1: Saved Workouts uses an explicitly labelled, intrinsic-size prominent capsule; all eight
  empty-state action sites and styled minimum-height wrappers were audited. The five other
  styled empty-state actions also use intrinsic sizing. The first simulator build passed.
  AX5 exposed horizontal clipping with fully fixed labels; actions now keep intrinsic height
  while allowing horizontal wrapping inside the List row.
- T3: owner approved vendoring MIT MuscleMap 1.6.4 in `Packages/MuscleMap`; the renderer now
  exposes `MuscleHitTester`. The target card uses a 0.25 s UIKit long press, hold/scrub/lift
  callbacks and a 2 s tap tooltip. Gesture cancellation clears the selection.
- T4b: owner approved the native Imported Data section. Removal and replacement target exactly
  `importSource == "hevy"`, run on a sibling private context, and merge object IDs into the UI.
  Replacement deletes and inserts in one save, reusing custom-exercise rollback. Measurements
  are kept. Invalid or partially malformed replacement files fail before deletion.
- Re-import deduplication also checks start second + exercise/set fingerprint for Hevy sessions,
  so title-only edits do not duplicate them. Editing the start time still changes identity;
  matching by content across dates would incorrectly merge repeated workouts. Replacement is
  the supported way to reconcile those edits without a new model attribute.
- B7 captions and B10 native accessory/logger zoom are implemented; Reduce Motion and iOS 17
  retain the existing overlay/fade. DEBUG-only launch routes support deterministic screen QA.
- T6: audio-session category setup runs on a serial queue; concurrent preload requests coalesce.
  Seed controls and launch seeding are confirmed behind `#if DEBUG`. Fixed a pre-existing test
  compile error by importing `WorkoutDataKit` with `@testable` in its test file.
- Final simulator `build-for-testing` and signed iPhone/Watch Debug builds passed. MuscleMap's
  220 package tests and all 19 isolated import service smoke checks passed. The iPhone install
  succeeded; iOS refused launch because the phone was locked. Runtime XCTest on
  the explicit simulator with `-parallel-testing-enabled NO` stalled before execution at
  `DTServiceHubClient failed to bless service hub` / `com.apple.instruments.deviceservice.lockdown`.
  No test success is claimed. The stalled runner was interrupted and terminated.
- T2: the light/dark default/AX3 screen matrix and AX5 empty-action check exposed and fixed
  invisible volume bars, clipped empty buttons, and unstable header collapse. Accessibility
  logger summaries now stack their values; set rows reflow into labelled fields instead of
  narrow table columns. Header and stepper touch targets meet 44 pt. See
  [`QA_2026-10-25.md`](QA_2026-10-25.md) for evidence and verification limits.
- Owner authorized direct coordination with WhereWolf's **Fix Live Activity display** chat
  (`01a170c9-8baf-7263-a0df-6fe990715e1d`). liteweight's simulator is
  `CACE2E28-29B0-46A4-96F5-B66ACB4631A1`; WhereWolf's is
  `E2C9ADC2-9481-4009-867F-7F00C53DC704`. Trade simulator/build windows directly; never reset
  the other app's data. AXe is available at `/tmp/overland-axe/axe` for simulator QA.
  The completed run restored liteweight's simulator to light/default sizing, shut it down, and
  returned all shared slots. The final signed build is installed; phone launch awaits unlock.
- No commits, pushes, stashes, resets or checkouts were performed. No contents of
  `reference-material/` were read or changed. T7 and equipment-setting designs remain proposals.

### 2026-10-25 morning visual follow-up

The owner rejected Home's blue glass haze, requested library theming, full-width exercise
detail cards, one exercise title, and clearance below the collapsed summary at the scroll top. These
now use the existing liteweight surface/type roles. The owner also approved Previous-result
capsules and 10 pt compact input outlines, and requested the remaining numeric font pass.
Live Activity rest now takes priority over the 10 s confirmation; ±15 intents await their
ActivityKit publication and countdowns suppress replacement/placeholder effects. Validation
for this follow-up is recorded in `QA_2026-10-25_FOLLOWUP.md`: all targets and the signed phone
build passed; the new phase resolver passed eight isolated checks. XCTest's host service is
still blocked. Default-light and AX3-dark screenshots confirm the visual changes. Phone install
succeeded; iOS denied launch because the phone was locked.

### 2026-10-25 afternoon cohesion, media and navigation follow-up

The owner rejected the partial font pass. A full-page comparison corrected Home's lower
data rows, measurement spacing and accessibility layout; shared `LiteweightMetricValue` and
`LiteweightWorkoutMetricLine` now keep numeric weights, units and metric colors consistent across
Home, History, Workout and logger. Library, picker, saved-workout tags and Custom Exercises
share row/tag treatments. Logger uses bold focused values, title3 compact values and theme
corner tokens. See `QA_2026-10-25_COHESION.md` for screenshots and validation.

The owner then reported missing exercise pictures and Show All Sessions filling the back
stack. A read-only phone exercise-definition audit found 49 empty custom definitions from
unmatched import names. Curated aliases/read-time enrichment recover 24 without changing
UUIDs, names, custom-file bytes or historical relationships; 25 need specific variants or
new catalog coverage. Unknown imagery uses a dumbbell instead of O. See
`EXERCISE_CATALOG_AUDIT.md` for the remaining names and verified free-media options.

The inline history card contained multiple NavigationLinks in one List row. It now sends
plain-button actions to one destination route owned outside the List by ExerciseDetailView.
Three Show All/back cycles and one individual-session/back cycle passed on the reported
History → exercise route. No historical records were merged or re-imported for these fixes.

### 2026-10-25 OpenGym catalog and Hevy matching

The owner stopped V2 comparisons and chose to keep liteweight, update its main dataset from
OpenGym and match imported Hevy names. This means imported-history matching, not automatic
Hevy account sync. Canonical OpenGym text at revision
`042c9ee42282756ab0e6e86a1cd5c710efaecee6` contributes 5,632 definitions. The library combines
these with 117 legacy-only records for 5,749 built-ins; all 1,441 original UUIDs/IDs and media
references survive. The converter and bundled AGPL/MIT notices preserve provenance.

Nine more reviewed Hevy aliases bring recovery to 33/49 observed custom definitions with
metadata, 25/49 with existing-source media. Original custom UUIDs, names and on-disk bytes are
kept; custom exact titles win over canonical titles during import. Sixteen unresolved names
remain available without guessed variant assignments. No workout records are merged.

Lists now persist a first-frame PNG from liteweight's existing provider; demos retain the original
GIF and its resolution. OpenGym's licensed media was not copied: its non-commercial exception
specifically permits OpenGym forks, not an independent app. Support for separately licensed
bundled `catalogue/still/` files is ready. See `EXERCISE_CATALOG_AUDIT.md` for checks and limits.

Catalog merge/matcher and still-cache fixture checks passed. Simulator app/test-bundle and
signed phone/Watch builds passed; the new build installed and launched on Josh's iPhone.
The test bundle compiled, but XCTest runtime still has the documented host-service limit.
Simulator screenshots verified alias search and custom metadata; shared slots were released.
Automatic approval review blocked the optional phone-file copy for a byte comparison, so
that post-install comparison is not claimed. No transfer was retried.

### 2026-10-26 native polish, daily recap and performance

The owner stopped the OpenGym-fork discussion and requested more native polish and faster
Home/History. Exercise toolbar label frames were removed to restore native spacing. Recent
rows now give titles/metadata/metrics full width, with a quiet chevron and bold text Repeat
below; the ellipsis menu offers Save as Workout. This opens a new transactional editor from
completed session data, preserving the source and Health provenance on Cancel, success or
failed-save rollback. Saved-workout targets support only their existing model fields/tags.

`TrainingHistoryStore` shares a debounced private-context snapshot of finished sessions,
day buckets, exercise totals, trained weeks and PR IDs. Home, History and calendars no longer
traverse every workout relationship from their view bodies. Exercise metadata uses a UUID
lookup refreshed with custom definitions. History's main selector is Workouts/Insights;
Exercise Progress remains in its options menu and reads cached totals.

Chart/selector rows are unified in History Insights, Body Measurements and saved workouts.
Daily calendar taps now open `TrainingDayRecapView`, with totals, all sessions, muscle focus
and measurements recorded that day. Month-grid buttons share one destination; large dates
scroll horizontally. Chart axes adapt at accessibility sizes and share the horizontal scrubber.
Settings uses native symbols/disclosures; deeper saved
workout fields and numeric keyboards use the metric type hierarchy, large-text reflow and
VoiceOver adjustment actions. App-only theme types are not linked into shared Siri controls.

Simulator app/test bundle and signed iPhone/Watch builds passed. The phone update installed;
launch was denied because the phone is locked. XCTest still stalls at DTServiceHub before
execution and the bounded attempt was stopped. Actual macOS Core Data service harnesses
passed snapshot totals/PR parity/streak/source preservation (600 sessions in ~24 ms), plus
saved-workout Cancel/Create/failure rollback/retry. See `QA_2026-10-26.md` for interaction and
visual checks and remaining limitations. No Git mutations or reference-material access.

### 2026-10-26 logger correction follow-up

The owner clarified that the collapsed summary must retain translucent glass, with content
starting lower rather than permanently excluded from behind it. It now floats over the scroll
viewport with measured top content margins (8 pt top plus 12 pt bottom gap), including AX sizes.

`WorkoutSetFocus` owns one next set across the active workout. Supersets alternate by round,
skipping empty/completed members; undo, reorder and pending deletion re-resolve from Core Data.
The editor, session progress marker, optional automatic superset scroll and Live Activity
superset snapshot use that same target. Ordinary ActivityKit anchor reconciliation is retained.

The iPhone high-refresh flag is enabled. Ruler position follows the finger continuously with
no per-event spring, while the selected duration and feedback snap to 15 s. Only release
commits changes. Duration timelines no longer rebuild static muscle paths/summary aggregates;
main-context child changes still invalidate them, including Watch events. No forced display
link or refresh loop was added. Actual iPhone frame pacing remains unprofiled.

Focused Core Data/ruler XCTest methods run natively on macOS (15 passed); simulator UI verified
one editor through A1 → B1 → A2 → B2, plus default/AX3 floating-glass clearance. See the
follow-up section in `QA_2026-10-26.md` for final build, delivery and test-host status.
Final signed build installed on Josh's iPhone (sequence 5548); launch is pending phone unlock.
The bounded simulator XCTest attempt still stalls at DTServiceHub before execution.

### 2026-10-26 owner correction: manual header and matching set shapes

The owner rejected automatic scroll-based summary collapse. Only explicit chevron/glass taps
now toggle it. Each workout starts expanded and remembers its mode in `SceneState`, including
minimize/reopen; expanding retains the current scroll position. Both scroll-offset observer
paths and the forced scroll-to-top workaround were removed. Glass/clearance behavior remains.

Previous results in regular/AX logger rows and historical set-result chips now use the same
continuous 10 pt rounded rectangle as compact weight/reps/duration fields. Regular Previous
boxes also match the 46 pt field height. Status/action shapes retain their existing theme roles. This supersedes the earlier Previous-capsule choice.

Simulator scrolling, explicit toggles and minimize/reopen checks passed. Signed iPhone/Watch
build passed; installed and launched successfully on Josh's phone (sequence 5556).

### 2026-10-26 header separation and organization design review

**Signing follow-up, 15:47 Eastern:** The owner reported "no longer available." The installed
Debug profiles (app, extensions and Watch) expired today around 14:23 Eastern; the earlier
successful installation/launch preceded that expiry. The app signature verifies on disk,
but the phone rejects launch with a signing/security error. An automatic renewal build stops
with `No Accounts` / no matching profiles: Xcode currently has no Apple Account signed in.
Xcode Settings → Apple Accounts is open at Sign In for the owner. Do not enter credentials or
delete the app. After the owner signs in, rebuild with `-allowProvisioningUpdates`, verify fresh
embedded profile dates, install over the existing app and verify launch. Compiler slot released
to WhereWolf; liteweight simulator remains shut down. Renewal log: `/tmp/liteweight-profile-renewal-build.log`.

**Resolved after owner sign-in:** The signed renewal build passed. All five embedded profiles
are fresh through 2026-11-02 (the app expires 14:52:45 EST), with the same team/bundle IDs and
valid signatures. Reinstalled over the existing app as sequence 5628; launch succeeded after
iOS verification settled. No app deletion or workout-data changes. Logs:
`/tmp/liteweight-profile-renewal-{build,install,launch}.log`.

The owner rejected the progress/summary gray panel and bottom rules, and reported duration
colliding with volume. Toolbar, strip and expanded metrics now share one header material;
header/metadata rules and the segment outline are removed. Explicit columns, 12 pt gutters,
compact elapsed formatting and top-aligned captions keep long values separated.

The owner approved the visual Superset sheet and compact Arrange Exercises sheet. The sheets
are implemented in `WorkoutOrganizationSheets.swift`, with transactional model changes in
`WorkoutOrganization.swift`. Superset has source/partner thumbnails, a two-round preview above
the choices and explicit Save/Cancel. Selecting a different group includes its members;
unselected former partners remain linked if two or more are left. Arrangement uses native
handles with staged order and Done/Cancel, preserving sets and superset identities.

Holding a header name or thumbnail opens Arrange; Reorder is also in its menu and accessibility
actions. The name uses an exclusive tap/hold gesture and value navigation so a hold cannot
navigate underneath the sheet. Ordinary tap/Back and hold/Cancel were exercised successfully.
Both sheets keep failed saves open and use the isolated persist/save rollback boundary. Nine
native Core Data regression tests passed, including stale selection/order rejection and failed
save rollback with unrelated pending edits preserved. Simulator drag, Cancel/Done and superset
Save/Cancel persistence checks passed. Default/dark AX3 inspection caught and fixed preview
overlap during a live text-size change by using a separate accessibility stack. Final builds
passed and iPhone installation/launch succeeded (sequence 5596). See `QA_2026-10-26.md` for
details. The interactive interaction reference remains in the thread's
`liteweight-workout-arrangement.html` visualization.

## 3. The owner: preferences and how they work

- Approves **visual design personally before it's built**. Show options; they choose.
- Liked: the rest timer inside the exercise; effort and RPE as their own color; the
  workout-complete recap; rows that **fill** blue on completion; today's **−15 / +15** rest
  strip; the session bar; Logger B's big steppers; the session chart with labels and visible
  rests.
- Rejected: stylized themes (Forge, Plate, Logbook); orange accent; **SF Rounded** ("cartoonish");
  the radial rest-timer modal ("disgustingly bad"); anything that reads as "Hevy merged with
  Liquid Glass"; beeps; graphs that look like random lines.
- Wants: Apple-quality animation everywhere; better sounds; speed (build to the phone fast);
  orchestration with parallel Codex workers. They are a capable engineer.
- Git: works on `main` of the fork `origin` (SoPat712/liteweight). Commit per feature or lane. Push
  only when asked. Never push upstream. `reference-material/` is untracked on purpose; never add it.
- Phone: "Josh's iPhone", UDID `00008150-001914903E69401C`, bundle `me.joshpatra.liteweight`,
  personal-team signing (`-allowProvisioningUpdates`). The free-team profile expires after
  about 7 days; if launch fails with a profile error, rebuild and reinstall.
- Ask before booting a simulator.

## 4. How the previous lead orchestrated (copy this)

Current delegation policy is in the owner's AGENTS.md instructions: root-session work by
default, at most one bounded independent child, no grandchildren, and isolated task briefs
with `fork_turns="none"`. The historical command below is reference, not permission to exceed
those limits or to commit.

- Workers: `codex exec -m gpt-6.1-sol -c model_reasoning_effort='"xhigh"' -c
  approval_policy='"never"' -s workspace-write --add-dir /tmp --add-dir /private/tmp -C <repo>
  -o <result.md> - < <brief.md>`. The owner uses **gpt-6.1-sol only**: xhigh by default and max
  for the hardest tasks. Use the default service tier, never fast or priority, and never astra.
- **`workspace-write` cannot run xcodebuild** (`sandbox_apply: Operation not permitted`).
  Either the lead builds after workers finish, or the owner allows `-s danger-full-access`.
- Each brief: role, lane, exact items (point at backlog IDs), files owned exclusively, "do not
  commit", "other agents are editing other files", and a short final report format.
- After workers finish: read each report, review the diffs (look for hard-coded colors, rounded
  fonts, `DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0)` inside scroll views, `onDisappear` resets, Health
  changes), then build, install on the phone, and commit per lane.
- Packages are pre-cloned in `/tmp/liteweight-spm`. `/tmp` gets wiped on reboot; if it's gone,
  run one normal `xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies` with network access, then copy
  `<derivedData>/SourcePackages` to `/tmp/liteweight-spm`.

## 5. Task list (priority order)

`[CODEX]` means implementable from specs now. `[OWNER]` needs the owner. `[LEAD]` is
orchestration or verification.

Continuation status: T1, T3, T4b and T5 are implemented in the working tree. T2's simulator
pass and T6's audio/debug/test investigation are recorded in the QA report; XCTest execution
remains blocked by the host service. The original task specifications below remain for reference.
T4 still requires an explicit push request. T7 and equipment configuration remain owner proposals.

### T1 [CODEX] The empty Saved Workouts "New Workout" button renders far taller than it is wide (owner-reported bug)
`liteweight/UI/Workout/StartWorkoutView.swift`, around line 398: `ContentUnavailableView { … } actions:
{ Button("New Workout", systemImage: "plus", action: newPlan).buttonStyle(.bordered)
.frame(minHeight: LiteweightTheme.controlHeight) }`, inside a `List` `Section`. The `.frame` sits
outside the button style, and `ContentUnavailableView` in a list row lets the action stretch
vertically, giving a narrow, very tall "+" bezel.

Fix:
- `Button(action: newPlan) { Label("New Workout", systemImage: "plus") }`
  `.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent).buttonBorderShape(.capsule).controlSize(.large)`
  `.labelStyle(.titleAndIcon).fixedSize()`, with no external `.frame`.
- Give the `ContentUnavailableView` `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` and
  `.listRowInsets(EdgeInsets(top: 24, leading: 16, bottom: 24, trailing: 16))`.
- Then audit **every** `ContentUnavailableView` with `actions:` and every `.frame(minHeight:)` on
  a styled button in the app for the same bug.
- Verify at the default text size and at AX5.

### T2 [LEAD] Visual QA pass of everything shipped since 2026-10-21
Nothing in `d6cdeb5`, `1ad5e22` or `c3f401a` has been looked at on screen. With the owner's OK,
boot one simulator, seed data (Debug builds have developer seed buttons in Settings), and
screenshot, in light and dark, at the default size and AX3:
- the logger: session bar, header expanded and collapsed, focused editor, swipe open, rest strip
  plus ruler, the exercise rest chip idle and running, soft set-type rows, the RPE sheet;
- the exercise detail: every segment, the empty state, the tooltip;
- the Workout tab, with history and without;
- Home.

Compare each against `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and the backlog acceptance criteria, then file and fix
deviations. Check that vertical scrolling works when a drag starts on the ruler, chart, map,
rows and steppers.

### T3 [CODEX] Muscle tooltip: true touch-and-hold, then drag to scrub
Today a tap or long-press shows the tooltip for 2 s. The package reports long-press **on
release**, and its drag recognizer steals scrolling. MuscleMap is MIT-licensed and its hit-testing
is internal. Options, in order of preference:
1. Use a public API if a newer package version exposes hit-testing.
2. Build an overlay with
   `LongPressGesture(0.25).sequenced(before: DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0))` and do the
   hit-testing against path data copied **through the package's public types only**.
3. If neither is possible, propose vendoring the package as a local Swift package
   with a public `muscle(at:)`, and get the owner's OK first, because it changes dependencies.

Spec: `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §9.8, backlog B6.3.

### T4 [OWNER] Push `3ab7e2f..c3f401a` to the fork's `main` when the owner says so
`git fetch origin && git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main main && git push origin main`

### T4b [CODEX, design the screen first] "Remove imported workouts" and re-import tools (owner request, 2026-10-25)
**What exists:** Hevy re-import already deduplicates. `HevyCSV.importData` builds a key
(start time rounded to the second, plus the normalized workout title) for every existing
workout and skips CSV sessions that match, reporting "N duplicate workouts skipped". Importing a
fresh full Hevy export therefore adds only the new sessions.

**Gaps to fix:**
1. A Hevy workout that the owner **renamed in liteweight**, or whose start time they edited,
   no longer matches and would be re-imported as a duplicate. Match imported workouts
   (`importSource == "hevy"`) by start second plus exercise and set fingerprint as well, so a
   title change alone doesn't defeat deduplication.
2. Sessions **edited in Hevy** after the first import are skipped, not updated.
3. There is no way to undo an import.

**Build**, in Settings → Import & Export, as a new "Imported Data" section:
- A summary row: "Hevy · 412 workouts · Oct 2019 – Oct 2026" (count and date range of
  `importSource == "hevy"`).
- **"Remove Imported Workouts"**, a destructive action:
  - It deletes only workouts with `importSource == "hevy"` (never liteweight-completed ones).
  - A `.confirmationDialog` states the count and says "Workouts you logged in liteweight are kept."
  - It runs on a background context with the import progress overlay pattern.
  - It refreshes exercise recency afterwards (it observes saves, so this is automatic).
  - Imported workouts were never exported, so there is no Apple Health effect; assert that in
    code.
- **"Replace with New Export…"**: pick a CSV, remove the imported workouts, then import, as one
  operation that rolls back if the import fails. This is the clean way to pick up workouts
  edited in Hevy.
- Optional: "Remove imported body measurements". Measurements merge by date today; check
  whether they're tagged before offering this.

Never touch workouts without `importSource`. Add unit tests for the deduplication key and the
removal predicate.

### T5 [CODEX] B7 recency captions and B10 motion gaps
These are optional and low priority (backlog B7 and B10). B10's accessory-to-logger zoom
transition is the most visible of them.

### T6 [CODEX] Known technical issues
- An `AVAudioSession` setup warning on the main thread at launch
  (`Shared/LiteweightSoundPlayer.swift`): move the session configuration off the main thread, or make
  it lazy and idempotent.
- `xcodebuild test` hangs before connecting in this environment. Investigate: try a specific
  simulator destination, `-parallel-testing-enabled NO`, and check for a test host that waits on
  HealthKit or WatchConnectivity.
- Debug-only developer seed buttons must stay out of Release. Confirm they are behind
  `#if DEBUG`.
- `WorkoutSetEditor.swift:143`: "TODO: let the user configure this for barbell, dumbbell and
  others" (plate and bar weights). This is a candidate setting; design it first.

### T7 [LEAD + OWNER] Design rounds still owed
These are unapproved, so design first:
- **Exercise touch states:** chart scrub callout and muscle hold. A board was planned but never
  drawn.
- **Add-exercise sheet with recency:** grouping and captions; a board was planned but never drawn.
- **Finish screen and History** re-check against the new fills (soft set-type colors in the
  session strip? Today the strip only knows warm-up, normal and record).
- **Watch app parity** with the new phone visuals (set fills, rest chip, RPE bars), on watchOS
  native controls.
- **Live Activity and widgets** using the session bar and metric colors.

Prepared directions for the next owner review (proposals, not approval to build):
- Touch states: keep the chart value/date in its existing headline while scrubbing, with one
  thin selection rule and no callout over marks. Show the muscle capsule directly above the
  held point, clamped to Target; the implemented gesture can be reviewed on the phone.
- Add Exercise: retain existing Recent-first ordering and muscle/equipment filters. The built
  relative-date captions disappear at accessibility sizes; any additional grouping needs a
  separate board before changing the current sections.
- Finish and History: extend the existing session-strip legend with soft drop/failure colors
  while preserving blue normal sets and yellow records. Review a mixed-set session first.
- Watch: use native List rows, blue completion, a compact cyan rest readout, and the existing
  effort bars adapted to the available width. Review the logger and RPE view together.
- Live Activity/widgets: retain native layouts, use the same time/sets/volume roles, and add
  a small session-progress bar only where it leaves the countdown and next set readable.
- Equipment setting (T6): a native Barbell Setup section under workout preferences, with bar
  weight and available plates in the chosen weight unit. Keep current defaults until approved;
  avoid introducing per-equipment increments without an explicit owner decision.

## 6. UI ideas log

Everything discussed or proposed so far, with its status.

### Approved and shipped
liteweight blue + one color per metric · SF Pro bold fixed-width numerals · fill sweep on set
completion · rest strip inside the exercise with −15 / pause / +15 / skip · rest drains an
`LiteweightRestRing` · inline rest-length ruler replacing the dial · rest chip at the top right of each
exercise card (countdown while resting) · focused current-set editor (Logger B: big fields, −/+
steppers, "Last time", plates hint, Add RPE, Log Set) · soft set-type fills (warm-up orange,
drop indigo, failure red) · RPE rising-bar picker · session effort rising bars ("How hard was
it?") · workout-complete recap (metrics grid, session strip with labelled rests, records,
saved-workout toggle, Health row) · History week grouping with totals, PR and RPE badges, compact
session strips, and an exercise breakdown capsule · Home weekly hero, day bars, best day, streak
chip, 4-week calendar, greeting, week-over-week caption · recency-first exercise ordering ·
exercise detail with inline progress (1RM, Weight, Volume, History; 1M–All), headline delta, PR
point, inline session history with set chips, target on the live-workout muscle map, tooltip
(not modal) · Recent Workouts with one-tap Repeat · session bar under the logger top bar ·
original procedurally generated sounds · import progress overlay · "Import & Export" label.

### Approved, implemented in the current uncommitted working tree
True hold-and-drag muscle tooltip (T3) · recency captions (B7) · accessory-to-logger zoom (B10).
Owner review on the installed phone is still useful; see the QA report for runtime evidence.

### Shown on the canvas but not adopted (keep for reference)
Round 4 "everything fills":
- tall set bars that fill blue, with no table header or Previous column;
- the rest bar filling cyan under the set, dragged left or right to add or remove 15 s and
  tapped to pause;
- a "Ready / Go" state;
- a pulsing glow ring on the next set when rest ends;
- an elapsed / volume / sets header above a big session bar (replaced by keeping today's
  summary plus a thin bar).

The owner kept today's timer and summary instead. **The glow on the next set when rest ends is
still a good, unrejected idea; propose it.**

### Proposed by the previous lead, never shown to the owner (design and ask before building)
1. **Progressive overload hint** in the focused editor: under "Last time 200 × 5", a quiet chip
   "Try 205 × 5" (+1 increment when all sets hit their target reps last time). Tap to fill.
2. **Next-set glow** when rest ends: an accent ring pulse on the focused editor, plus the
   `restComplete` sound.
3. **Muscle Focus as a heatmap.** MuscleMap supports `.heatmap(_:colorScale:)`. Replace Home's
   muscle bars with a front and back heat map of the last 4 weeks' sets, in accent intensity
   only (not rainbow).
4. **Exercise "Bests" card** on the detail page: heaviest weight, best e1RM, most reps, best
   session volume, each with a date and a record badge.
5. **Plate visual** in the plate calculator and focused editor: a tiny barbell drawing with
   plates per side as colored rounded rectangles (neutral, sized by weight), instead of text
   only.
6. **Warm-up generator:** from the first working set, propose 2–3 warm-up sets (e.g. 40%, 60%,
   80%) using plate math, added as W sets.
7. **Superset rail:** linked exercises share a 3 pt accent rail along their cards' leading edge,
   labelled "Superset".
8. **Exercise thumbnails** in History rows and the Recent Workouts list (the first 3
   exercises' diagrams, overlapped).
9. **App icon:** a blue weight plate seen face-on (systemBlue rim, darker blue inner ring,
   black hub). Sketched on the canvas "System · liteweight blue" board. It needs light, dark and
   tinted variants.
10. **Lock Screen widget:** the rest countdown and next set, with Smart Stack relevance during
    workouts.
11. **Weekly streak widget:** the week's day bars plus the streak.
12. **First-run flow:** a welcome screen and "Import from Hevy" as the first-class second step;
    Health permission explained (exports only liteweight-completed workouts).
13. **Inline exercise notes** in the logger, shown as a secondary line under the exercise name
    and editable in place.
14. **Body tab charts** restyled to the §10 chart rules (`metricBody` purple).
15. **Session strip set-type colors:** add drop and failure kinds to `LiteweightSessionStrip`, so the
    recap and History match the new soft fills.

## 7. Lessons and pitfalls (the "intellect")

- **List prefetch versus entrance animations:** never reset appear state in `onDisappear`, or
  prefetched rows stay invisible. This caused an "invisible effort graph" bug.
- **Horizontal gestures inside a scroll view:** use `HorizontalSwipeRecognizer`
  (`UIGestureRecognizerRepresentable`, begins only when |vx| > |vy|) on iOS 18 and later. A
  SwiftUI `DragGesture` swallows vertical scrolls. This caused "can't scroll when starting on a
  set row".
- **Floating glass over a scroll view:** inset the content with `.contentMargins(.top, h, for:
  .scrollContent)` so it never covers the first item.
- **Heavy work:** imports and history scans run off the main actor (`Task.detached` or a
  private-queue context), with progress UI. Exercise recency is one dictionary-result fetch
  with a debounced refresh on save.
- **Health:** eligibility is decided at finish time and stored (`healthExportState`); retries
  happen on scene activation; the Watch owns its own `HKWorkoutBuilder` sample and the phone
  never duplicates it.
- **Core Data:** model v6 (`importSource`, `healthExportState`) with a staged v5 → v6 migration.
  Any new attribute needs v7 plus a migration stage.
- **Codex** follows long, exact specs well, but will take a "permitted fallback" quickly. Say
  explicitly when a fallback is unacceptable.
- **Signing:** the liteweightIntentsUI target uses the owner’s entitlements in both configurations
  (`liteweightIntentsUI/liteweightIntentsUI.entitlements`); don't reintroduce upstream app
  groups there.
- **Siri extensions restored:** they were shelved on 2026-11-01 to save App IDs on the free team.
  On the paid team they are embedded again as `me.joshpatra.liteweight.intents` and
  `me.joshpatra.liteweight.intentsui`, and `Shortcuts.isAvailable` is true. The restore is in checkpoint
  `1607275`. Live Activity buttons use App Intents in `Shared/WidgetKit/WidgetKind.swift` and don't
  depend on these extensions.
- **Canvas:** the design canvas is a claude.ai artifact
  (<https://claude.ai/artifact/XwxfzWTFvH2PNZWqMRpihv>; pages Round 1–5). Agents without the
  Artifact tool can't edit it. Use SwiftUI previews and screenshots for design proposals
  instead, and record approved decisions in `DESIGN_BACKLOG.md`'s decisions log.
